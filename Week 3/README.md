# Coursera_Capstone
This is the project under the Coursera course titled "IBM Data Science - Applied Data Science Capstone".

In this project, we segment and cluster all neighborhoods in the Canadian city Toronto, with the help of FourSquare API. Furthermore, we visualize the geaographical distribution of these neighborhood clusters with the help of the Folium, a Python Mapping Library.

Here are the Toronto Neighborhoods before Clustering :
